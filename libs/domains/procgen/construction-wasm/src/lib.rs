//! Wasm bridge exposing `grafting-graph-core`'s construction operations and
//! the terrain-generation/structure-generation crates' pure generators as
//! one stateful `ConstructionSession` for the Web host. Pure wiring only --
//! see this crate's `AGENTS.md` for the boundary this crate must not cross.

//! Modules land incrementally as each piece is implemented; this crate is
//! not yet functional.
